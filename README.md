# Connexion_prover
This is a connectivity tester between two cables connected to two devices.

# Project Description

This project is a simple continuity tester designed to verify the electrical connection between two cables or devices. It detects whether there is a closed circuit between two test points and provides a clear indication of connectivity. The system is built using an Arduino-based design and includes visual and physical feedback to make testing fast and intuitive.

# Why I Made This Project

I built this project to have a quick and practical tool for checking cable connections and basic electrical continuity in devices at my institute. During practical work, it is common to find faulty cables or broken internal connections, and having a dedicated tester makes troubleshooting faster and more efficient.

Additionally, this project allowed me to apply electronics and programming concepts in a real-world application, reinforcing what I learned in class.

# How to Use This Project

To use the continuity tester, connect the two test probes to the points or cables you want to check. If there is electrical continuity between them, the device will indicate it (for example, through an LED or other output signal). If there is no connection, the device will show no signal.

The tester is powered via USB, making it easy to use with any compatible device or power source.
